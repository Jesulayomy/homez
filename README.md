## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ejs, Node.js, MongoDB

The application was built using ejs and bootstrap for the front end, providing a responsive user interface. The back end is powered by Node.js and Express, with MongoDB as the database to store user data and item information.

## Optimizations
I used the bootstrap framework to assist in applying styling to the page, making it feel responsive and consistent across different browsers and screens.

## Lessons Learned:

This project made me reach out to more technologies, I learned to embed an iframe map into a site with dynamic location using Google Maps Embed API
